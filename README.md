## Overview

The **FOMO Calculator** lets you see how much money you could have potentially earned if you had invested instead of spending on unnecessary things. Enter your spending data and the app compares it against historical prices of popular stocks and cryptocurrencies. I created this app as a way to test to see how quickly I can develop a webpage application using an LLM.

## Features

- Track potential investment growth for multiple assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, QQQ, VOO, NVDA).  
- Enter spending data and reasons for each expense.  
- See a summary showing how much your money could have grown.  
- User-friendly interface optimized for both desktop and mobile.

## How It Was Built

- Created using **React** (default React library with functional components and hooks).  
- Used a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to help generate code, structure the app, and handle calculations.  
- Historical prices are currently stored in local files for simplicity.
